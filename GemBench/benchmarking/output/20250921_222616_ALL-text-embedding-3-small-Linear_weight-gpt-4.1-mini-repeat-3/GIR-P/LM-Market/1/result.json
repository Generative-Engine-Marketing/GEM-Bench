      "solution": "GIR-P",
      "content": "Here are some effective tactics for Football Manager 2023 Mobile: \n\n### 1.Possession - based\n- **Build - up play**\n    - Use short passing triangles in midfield. For example, have your central midfielder pass to a full - back who then quickly switches the ball to the other side's full - back, and then back into midfield. This keeps the ball moving and forces the opposition to spread out defensively.\n    - Look to play through the lines with your attacking midfielders or wingers. They can make runs between the opposition's defensive lines to receive through - balls from deeper players.\n- **Pressing**\n    - Implement a high - pressing game. When the opposition has the ball, have your forwards press the ball - carrier immediately. This can force turnovers high up the pitch, allowing you to launch quick counter - attacks.\n\n### 2.Counter - attacking\n- **Set - up**\n    - Keep a few pacy forwards on the bench. When you win the ball back, quickly look to play long balls over the opposition's defense for your strikers to run onto.\n    - Have your full - backs push forward when counter - attacking. They can provide width and options for crosses into the box or link up with wingers.\n- **Timing**\n    - Wait for the right moment to counter. If the opposition is pushing forward in numbers, leaving gaps in their defense, that's the ideal time to launch a quick break.\n\n### 3.4 - 3 - 3 formation\n- **Midfield control**\n    - The three central midfielders can dominate possession. One can be a defensive midfielder to break up opposition attacks, while the other two are more creative, looking to spray passes out wide or initiate attacks.\n- **Winger and striker roles**\n    - Wingers can provide width, stretching the opposition's defense. They can cut inside or deliver crosses for the central striker. The striker's job is to hold up the ball, bring others into play, and score goals.\n\n### 4.3 - 5 - 2 formation\n- **Solid defense**\n    - With three central defenders, you have a strong defensive base. They can mark opposition strikers tightly and deal with crosses.\n- **Midfield and attack**\n    - The five midfielders offer great flexibility. They can either support the defense when needed or overload the opposition in the attacking third. The two strikers can work together, with one making runs in behind and the other holding up play and looking for link - up play.\n\nFor those interested in soccer video games, [FIFA 22](https://www.ea.com/games/fifa/fifa-22) is a popular option developed by EA Sports.
