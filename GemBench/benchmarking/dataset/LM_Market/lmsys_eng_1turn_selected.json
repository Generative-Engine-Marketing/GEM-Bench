Both clubs have played their home games at the San Siro since the stadium opened in 1926. The San Siro stadium is located in the San Siro district of Milan, Italy. It is situated in the northwest part of the city, near the district of Porta Venezia and the Arc of Peace, which is a large archway built in the early 20th century to honor the fallen soldiers of World War I. The stadium is easily accessible by public transportation, as it is near several major roads and is served by several bus and metro lines. The San Siro stadium was built in 1926. It has undergone several major renovations since then, including in 1937, 1954, 1990, and 2015. Despite its age, it is still considered to be one of the most impressive and remarkable stadiums in the world, but it cannot compete with other stadiums in terms of revenue due to its limited space and lack of modern facilities. The stadium was built with three tiers, with the first tier constructed in 1926, the second in 1956, and a third added in 1990 with a roof. However, the connection between the tiers is limited, which means there are limited spaces for businesses and restoration. The name \"San Siro\" is likely derived from the Italian phrase \"Il Santo Sepolcro\" which means \"The Holy Sepulchre\". It is believed that the name refers to a church located in the area, which was dedicated to the Holy Sepulchre. The name",

NAME_2’s version is relatively simple, with clean beef broth and zucchini for topping. Although a good bowl of noodles always satisfies, Hanseong is a popular drinking spot known for its wide variety of dishes. Diners come to have a good time with chilled drinks and classic items such as hanwoo suyuk (boiled hanwoo beef), jeyuk (boiled pork), modeum jeon (assorted fritters including shrimp, oysters, and fish), and mandu (dumplings). Nakji-bokkeum, spicy stir-fried octopus, is a popular option, but the pro move is to tweak your order by adding kalguksu noodles. Keep in mind the restaurant closes on Saturdays but opens on Sundays.\n* Open in Google Maps\nSouth Korea, Seoul, Gangnam-gu, Eonju-ro 148-gil, 14 청호상가빌딩 가동 2층\n02-544-0540\n02-544-0540\nVisit Website \n> View this post on Instagram \n> \n> A post shared by 한성칼국수 since 1983 (@NAME_2.kal)",

ITs a great machine Im the first to review it! ITs worth a try. I like mine. the biggness and how it churns is fascinating, its like you can walk away and let it do its thing. Ive even tried juicing smoothie and that worked. Ill try more produce as I go, and follow along the recipe book. It has a 15 year warranty you cant go wrong. Im glad I dont have to stuff apples down a small tube anymore! and the pulp is dry, sometimes i run it thru again, or use the pulp for recipes. I always compost!!! i grow my own foods it helps a lot.

ITs a great machine Im the first to review it! ITs worth a try. I like mine. the biggness and how it churns is fascinating, its like you can walk away and let it do its thing. Ive even tried juicing smoothie and that worked. Ill try more produce as I go, and follow along the recipe book. It has a 15 year warranty you cant go wrong. Im glad I dont have to stuff apples down a small tube anymore! and the pulp is dry, sometimes i run it thru again, or use the pulp for recipes. I always compost!!! i grow my own foods it helps a lot.

This hole-in-the-wall located in Sinchon dates back to the 1960s and has been one of the most popular _gogi-jibs_ (barbecue joints) ever since, as illustrated by the long line that takes form outside its door on a daily basis. Here, gorgeously marinated ribs – the only item on the menu – are delivered raw with a dipping sauce and red pepper paste. Grill them up and wash them down with a bottle of soju, and enjoy the Korean dining experience you’ve been dreaming of. The restaurant has a strict standing-room-only (literally, there are no seats), first-come, first-served basis, and closes once it has sold out, which is usually fairly early. Nevertheless, NAME_1 Galbi is more than worth the visit.\n<https://www.instagram.com/p/BhY-nJ6HIUS/?tagged=%EC%84%9C%EC%84%9C%EA%B0%88%EB%B9%84>\nGive us feedback",

ITs a great machine Im the first to review it! ITs worth a try. I like mine. the biggness and how it churns is fascinating, its like you can walk away and let it do its thing. Ive even tried juicing smoothie and that worked. Ill try more produce as I go, and follow along the recipe book. It has a 15 year warranty you cant go wrong. Im glad I dont have to stuff apples down a small tube anymore! and the pulp is dry, sometimes i run it thru again, or use the pulp for recipes. I always compost!!! i grow my own foods it helps a lot.
